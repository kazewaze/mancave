This post will cover **what a Basic Neural Network looks like in Python and how it works internally**. It will give us a great jumping off point for future posts that will be more complex. Below is a preview of the code for the post to come. Have a Blessed Day!

```py
'''
Simplest Neural Network
  - Single Weight
  - Single Input Datapoint
'''

# Weight (single) ~ [knowledge]:
weight = 0.1

# Data:
data = [8.5, 9.5, 10, 9]

# Input (single) ~ [information]:
input = data[0]

# Neural Network:
def neural_network(input, weight):
    pred = input * weight
    return pred

# Prediction:
print(neural_network(input, weight))
```
