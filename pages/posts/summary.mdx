The following posts will cover a range of topics that mainly fall within the categories listed below. I'm a Computer Science Student at a University and plan on posting semi-often on everything I learn to help test/solidify my knowledge. If it happens to be useful for others then I will be all the more pleased, but this is not the original intent of these coming posts.

- **AI**: The **Field of Artificial Intelligence** as a whole.
- **Machine Learning**: A **Subfield of Computer Science and AI**.
- **Deep Learning**: A **Subset of Machine Learning**.
- **Python**: The most popular and **my chosen programming language for this endeavor**.

At the time of writing I am currently waiting for the Fall Semester to start, but until then I am working through Andrew Trask's book **"grokking Deep Learning"**. For all that took time to read this, assuming there were any, I appreciate it and have a Blessed Day!
